Integrating Arduino with Python-based hand gesture recognition to control LED outputs in real time. Used computer vision to detect gestures and translate them into electrical signals via serial communication.
For people who are looking for python documentation for mediapip handlandmark, this video was very helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGEyIfX4GGk (not a shoutout or anything like that but future developers might find this really helpful)

# NOTE:
This project was written in python 3.12.x; just a heads up because there may be compatability issues surrounding the various libraries
